## Business Problem

The goal of this project is to predict student marks by analyzing the relationship between study hours and academic performance using a Linear Regression model.

## Load Dataset

The dataset contains the following columns:

- `study_hours`: The number of hours a student spent studying.
- `student_marks`: The final marks achieved by the students.

## Discover and Visualize the Data to Gain Insights

Before building the model, we performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to visualize and understand the dataset's characteristics and distributions.

## Prepare the Data for Machine Learning Algorithms

Data preparation includes:

- Handling any missing data.
- Ensuring the data is in a suitable format.
- Splitting the data into training and testing sets.

## Data Cleaning

To ensure data quality and model accuracy, we performed the necessary data cleaning steps:

- Addressed missing data.
- Detected and handled outliers.
- Applied feature scaling or normalization as required.
- Encoded categorical variables (if applicable).

## Machine Learning Algorithm

We used the scikit-learn library to implement a Linear Regression model. The model predicts student marks based on the number of study hours.

## Split Dataset

To assess the model's performance, we split the dataset into training and testing sets.

## Select a Model and Train It

We selected the Linear Regression model and trained it using the training dataset.
