## Business Problem

In this project, we have developed a predictive model to estimate student marks based on a set of input features. The project uses the Linear Regression algorithm to establish a linear relationship between the features and the predicted marks.

## Load Dataset

The project utilizes a dataset that is available in the [data/](data/) directory. This dataset contains the following columns:

- study_hours`: This column represents the number of hours a student spent studying for an exam.
- `student_marks`: This column represents the final marks obtained by the students in the exam.
- ...
- `marks`: The final marks achieved by the students.

## Data Exploration

To gain insights into the data, we performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to visualize and understand the dataset's characteristics and distributions.

## Data Preparation

Before applying machine learning algorithms, we prepared the data by:

- Addressing missing values, if any.
- Detecting and handling outliers.
- Applying feature scaling or normalization as required.
- Encoding categorical variables (if applicable).

## Data Cleaning

To ensure data quality and model accuracy, we performed the following data cleaning steps:

- Addressed missing values, if any.
- Detected and handled outliers.
- Applied feature scaling or normalization as required.
- Encoded categorical variables (if applicable).

## Machine Learning Algorithm

We implemented the Linear Regression model using the scikit-learn library. The model follows the equation: `y = m * x + c`, where:

- `y` represents the predicted marks.
- `m` is the slope of the regression line.
- `x` corresponds to the input features.
- `c` is the intercept.

The model was trained on the cleaned dataset to make accurate predictions based on the provided features.

## Data Splitting

To assess the model's performance, we split the dataset into training and testing sets.

## Model Training

We selected the Linear Regression model and trained it using the training dataset.
